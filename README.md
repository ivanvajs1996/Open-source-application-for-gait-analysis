Open source application for gait analysis using xsens sensors


An application for realtime gait analysis in the form of gait segmentation and stride length estimation.

A total of 6 MTw Awinda sensors were used, and the application requires an installation of the Xsens software development kit that can be found in the MT software suit at https://www.xsens.com/software-downloads. 

The fuctionalities of the application as well as the validation experiment can be found in the paper:
